This is our final project in Advanced GIS ENV 859 at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment.

We are looking at gray whale migration data. Using Python and ArcGIS, we create a tool that allows the user to input a date (year optional) and see whether a whale observation was recorded on that date as well as the coordinates of the observation, the time it was recorded, the sea surface temperature at that location, and the years of the observations (if year was not specified in the initial query).
